# floodriskmap
A flood susceptibility map was generated using a weighted multi-criteria approach integrating SRTM-derived terrain parameters, MERIT Hydro variables, distance to water, and ESA WorldCover land cover data. The resulting continuous index was classified into five percentile-based risk classes, excluding permanent water areas.
